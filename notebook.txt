---- Java script course - notebook Omer Dagan ----

- statments must end with a semicolon the same as in C

** external files **
1. java script can either be embedded directly in an html file or 'js' file
	see demo.js and test.html
2. external files, i.e. '.js' extension cannot contain '<script>' tags
3. to embbed a external file use '<script src="SRC_FILE"></script>'
4. advantage of external file use
	a. seperate HTML from code
	b. better readability and maintainability
	c. Cached files improve loadtime - if the same logic is used across the site then external 
		files can greatly improve performance

** variables **
*** variable naming rules ***
- The first character must be:
	--letter
	--underscore (_)
	--a dollar sign ($)
  Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
- Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
- Variable names cannot include a mathematical or logical operator in the name. 
	For instance, 2*something or this+that;
- JavaScript names must not contain spaces.
- Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. It is reserved for subtractions.

*** string excape charecters ***
- \' , \" , \\ - backlash , \n - newline , \r - carrige return , \t - tab , \b - backspace
  \f - form feed

1. variables in javascript are case sensitive
2. 'var' keyword denotes a variable
3. numbers are always stored as double precision floating point
4. strings:
	- can be defined either by single or double quotes
	- string can contain a quotes as long as they dont match the surronding quotes

*** operators *** 
for most, operators are the same as in C with the exception of the identity operator
 which compares value and type. to better understand this:
			var number = 5;
			var string = "5";
			number == string;   —> true
			number === string; —> false (value is equal but the type is not)

5. JS also support shortend if i.e. 'variable = (condition) ? true_value: false_value'

*** functions ***
